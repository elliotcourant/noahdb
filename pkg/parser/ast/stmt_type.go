	// the statement was applied.

	// CopyIn indicates a COPY FROM statement.

	// Unknown indicates that the statement does not have a known
	// return style at the time of parsing. This is not first in the
	// enumeration because it is more convenient to have Ack as a zero
	// value, and because the use of Unknown should be an explicit choice.
	// The primary example of this statement type is EXECUTE, where the
	// statement type depends on the statement type of the prepared statement
	// being executed.
